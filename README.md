## Introduction

Synthify is a Python-based tool designed to generate synthetic browsing profiles, which mimic the behavior of real users online. Whether you are a data scientist, a privacy advocate, or a developer, Synthify enables you to create customizable synthetic profiles with ease.

### Prerequisites

To use Synthify, you need to have the following dependencies installed on your system:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pandas library
- Scikit-learn library
- Numpy library

## Features

- **Random Forest Algorithm:** Utilizing the power of the Random Forest Algorithm, Synthify can produce profiles that closely resemble real-world browsing patterns.
- **Configurable Parameters:** Customize the attributes and behavior of the synthetic profiles by tweaking various parameters in the algorithm.
- **Privacy Protection:** Use synthetic profiles for data augmentation or sharing, ensuring the protection of real user information.
- **Easy Integration:** The `app.py` file allows you to seamlessly integrate Synthify into your existing projects or applications.
- **Sample Dataset Included:** Experiment with the provided `data.csv` file to quickly get started.

## Installation

To install Synthify, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/synthify.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd synthify`

## Usage

1. Make sure you have installed all dependencies as mentioned in the installation section.
2. Run the `app.py` file: `python app.py`
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to generate synthetic browsing profiles.
4. The generated profiles will be saved to an output file for further use.

## Dataset

The provided `data.csv` file serves as a sample dataset to demonstrate how Synthify works. Feel free to replace it with your own dataset for a more tailored synthesis process.

## Model

The `model.pkl` file contains the trained Random Forest model, which is the backbone of Synthify's profile generation process. It has been pre-trained on a diverse and representative dataset to ensure the high-quality generation of synthetic profiles.
